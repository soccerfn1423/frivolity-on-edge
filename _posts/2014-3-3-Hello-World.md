title: My First Blog Post Using Jekyll
---

I could've just as easily used  HTML to create this page, but I wanted to give Jekyll a try. So far, so good. The simplicity, security, and speed of this static site generator really draws me to it. Not only does it create entirely HTML-driven sites, but they are also pre-rendered, which means less load times for visitors.
