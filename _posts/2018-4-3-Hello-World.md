title: My First Blog Post Using Jekyll
---

I could've just as easily used another platform like Wordpress to create this page, but I wanted to give Jekyll a try. So far, so good. The simplicity, security, and speed of this static site generator really draws me to it. Not only does it create entirely HTML-driven sites, but they are also pre-rendered, which means less load times for visitors, especially when I start adding images and other elements.

So anyway, I'm currently watching the Academy Awards, and I must say, I can't wait for it to be over. Like everybody else, I'm only here to learn who wins Best Picture. Wait, I have to retract what I just said about me not wanting to watch the whole thing. The reason? A defining moment of the awards this year was that Kobe Bryant won his first Oscar for Best Animated Short Film for "Dear Basketball." What an accomplishment! To transition from a legendary career in the NBA to screenwriting for his self-narrated film is nothing short of amazing, especially as he made the switch in such a brief window of time. It's that Mamba Mentality at play again. Honestly, he kills it in anything he sets his mind to. I hope more people from under-represented groups have a fair chance to win an Oscar; at the very least, even a nomination for individuals from these groups would demonstrate that the Academy is shedding its age-old reservations.

Time for the final reveal! These are the nominees for Best Picture. Phantom Thread; Darkest Hour; Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri; Call Me By Your Name; Get Out; Dunkirk; The Post; Shape of Water. And the Oscar goes to...The Shape of Water.
