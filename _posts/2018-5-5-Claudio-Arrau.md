Claudio Arrau was a man of singular genius. That he gave his life to the meticulous performance and interpretation of great classical works does not astound me. What does atonish me was that he did not have a professional musician in the family to guide him as a youth. His mother was an amateur pianist who gave lessons to tutees to supplement her family's meager income. As a child, Claudio would sit in during his mother's tutoring sessions.
